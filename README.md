# Impostor Hunt
[View live project here] (website address)

Inspired by Twitch Streamer "Warwick Zero" and the game "Among Us" Imposter Hunt utilises both the main game dynamic of Among Us and that of traditional memory games. 

This is the second of four Mile Stone Projects, and to date the most difficult and on occasion mind melting project I have ever faced.

The brief was to build an interactive front-end site that responds to users' actions, allowing them to actively engage with data, alter the way the site displays the information to achieve their preferred goals.

## User Experience

### Returning User

- Beat previous vote count in completing the hide and seek esque challenge.
- Improve memory
- Find the social media for the streamer "Warwick Zero".

## Design
### Colour schemes
The Colour Scheme of the game is inspired by the Among Us' main colour schemes with all character colours taken from the hexadecimal colour palate. 
### Typography 
"Press Start 2P" - Imposter Hunt features similar font styling to the game 'Among Us' and stylistic for the game- it is used sparingly in headers for the overall page and all Game Start/Over notices.

"Playfair Display SC" - is a complimentary font to "Press Start 2P" and is clear easier to read when proving the user with information about number of votes (clicks made) cast and the time remaining.

### Imagery
All imagery is inspired by Among US and has been recreated and drawn by the Myself. The Impostor character is completely custom and created off the look of the Streamer Warwick Zero. These are technically fan art.

### Languages Used
HTML
CSS
Javascript

## Frameworks used
Balsamic: used to create the wire frames
Bootstraps:  
Font Awesome
Git
GitHub
Google Fonts:
JQuery
Procreate: Procreate was used to create the logo, 

## Testing
Validates

### User goals

### Further Testing
Website was tested on a variety of browsers including Google Chrome, Safari, Firefox, And Edge.
The website was viewed on a variety of devices including desktop, laptop and mobile on both iOS and Android.

The Website was provided to friends and family and used on stream by both Warwick Zero and his mod team Vhler in order to obtain unbiased review and feedback on user experience from both the streamer and their chat.

## Bugs

I found early bugs in using Safari for the game. The cards came pre-flipped and would flip the image across the Y axis as used in the transition this was corrected by hiding the backface of the card face.

Building the card flip function.
When adding the initial code all cards would turn face, without the need for a click. Which is counterproductive to the game. I've tried Jquery and could get the action to work but due to insecurities on jQuery knowledge I opted to write in plain javascipt.

Through discussion with peers I came across the problem, the mistake and have made and the attempted.
